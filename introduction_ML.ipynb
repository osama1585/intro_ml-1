    "- Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.\n",

    "### Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "- Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms use statistical techniques to enable computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "- **Example**: Spam email detection. An email service provider uses ML algorithms to analyze the content and characteristics of emails. By training on labeled data (spam vs. non-spam emails), the algorithm learns to classify new emails as either spam or non-spam based on the features it has learned.\n",

    "### Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "- Deep Learning is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to learn representations of data in a hierarchical manner. DL algorithms are particularly effective for tasks involving large amounts of data, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n",
    "- **Example**: Image recognition. A DL model trained on a dataset of labeled images can accurately classify images into different categories. For example, a DL model trained on a dataset of cat and dog images can distinguish between cats and dogs in new images it has not seen before.\n",

Unsupervised learning techniques are commonly used in anomaly detection because they do not require labeled data and can identify anomalies by learning patterns inherent in the data.\n",

    "- **Example Algorithm**: An example of a density-based anomaly detection algorithm is DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). DBSCAN identifies outliers as points that lie in regions of low density, defined as areas with fewer neighboring points than a specified threshold.\n",

    "### Novelty Detection:\n",
    "- **Approach**: Novelty detection algorithms aim to identify anomalies by learning the normal behavior of the data and flagging instances that deviate significantly from this learned pattern. These algorithms build a model of the normal data distribution and label instances that fall outside a certain threshold as anomalies.\n",
    "- **Example Algorithm**: One example of a novelty detection algorithm is One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine). One-Class SVM learns a representation of the normal data and classifies new instances as either belonging to the normal class or as anomalies.\n",
